# Summary in 10 Bullet Points

- The paper discusses the concept of "hidden technical debt" in machine learning (ML) systems.
- Hidden technical debt refers to the accumulation of technical debt that occurs in the design and implementation of ML systems, which can result in decreased system performance, increased maintenance costs, and other negative consequences.
- The authors identify several sources of hidden technical debt in ML systems, including data dependencies, production-inequality mismatches, configuration issues, and undeclared consumers.
- The paper proposes a framework for identifying and addressing hidden technical debt in ML systems, which includes the following steps:
  - Conducting a comprehensive audit of the ML system to identify potential sources of technical debt.
  - Prioritizing technical debt based on its impact on the system's performance and the resources required to address it.
  - Developing a plan to address the identified technical debt, which may involve redesigning the system architecture, improving documentation and testing processes, and implementing new monitoring and alerting systems.
- The authors emphasize the importance of addressing hidden technical debt proactively to avoid the negative consequences it can have on ML system performance and maintainability.
